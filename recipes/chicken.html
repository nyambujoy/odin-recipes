<p>The key to the best crispy fried chicken Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.
    · Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat — after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.
    · Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</p>
